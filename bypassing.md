# Bypass the Firewall Rules

To bypass the firewall rules, 

1. From your browser, open  [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal navigation, go to **Devices > Device List** and click on the firewall protected device you want to bypass.
3.  In the **Firewall** tab, click on the **Actions** dropdown menu and choose **Bypass Rules**. Click **Yes** to confirm the action. Bypassing the rules takes approximately two minutes to take effect. While in bypass mode, the "Status" will be "Bypassing All Rules".

## Enable the Rules Again

To enable the rules again, follow the instructions above to reach the Firewall tab of the device and click on the **Actions** dropdown menu and choose **Process Rules**. The "Status" should change back to "Processing All Rules" within two minutes.
