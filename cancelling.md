# Cancel a Firewall

Firewalls can be cancelled at any time. To cancel a Hardware Firewall (Shared), 

1. From your browser, open  [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal navigation, go to **Devices > Device List** and click on the firewall protected device you want to cancel.
3.  In the **Firewall** tab, click on the **Actions** dropdown menu and choose **Cancel Firewall**. In the next dialog, choose whether you want to cancel immediately or at the next billing cycle.

This will leave all devices on the VLAN without front end firewall protections. This service is provided month to month and billing will be discontinued for the next month upon cancellation.
