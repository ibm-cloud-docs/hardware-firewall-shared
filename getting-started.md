# Getting Started
The Hardware Firewall (Shared) provides customers with an essential layer of security that is provisioned on demand without service interruptions. It prevents unwanted traffic from hitting your servers, reducing your attack surface, and allowing your server resources to be dedicated for their intended use. 

To order a Hardware Firewall (Shared), first navigate to the order page in the customer portal:

1. From your browser, open the [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com/) and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal select **Security > Network Security  > Firewalls**.
3. From the **Firewalls** page, select the **Order Multi VLAN Firewall** link in the top right corner. This link opens the Multi VLAN Firewall order page.

If your account does not currently have any Multi VLAN Firewalls associated with it, a message displays with a link to the order page.

From the Multi VLAN Firewall order page, you can order your FSA 1Gbps firewall:

1. Give the firewall a name.
2. Select the desired Datacenter and Pod from the dropdown menus. Availability is limited to select locations.
3. Choose the desired VLANs Configuration.
4. Choose to have a single firewall or enable failover protection with the High Availability option.
5. Choose from the list of Add-ons or bundle all of them together for a discounted price. The Order Summary box displays the updated information for your current order. 
6. Select the **Master Service Agreement** checkbox once you review your order. 
7. Submit your order by clicking **Place Order**.
