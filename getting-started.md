# Getting started with Hardware Firewall
{: #getting-started}

The Hardware Firewall provides customers with an essential layer of security that is provisioned on demand without service interruptions. It prevents unwanted traffic from hitting your servers, reducing your attack surface, and allowing your server resources to be dedicated for their intended use.

The Fortinet shared firewall will reach End of Support (EOS) on 31 December 2026. After this date, it will no longer be supported or available for use on IBM Cloud.

To add a firewall to a server, perform the following procedure:

1. From your browser, open the [IBM Cloud catalog](/catalog){: external} and log in to your account.
2. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the upper left, then click **Infrastructure > Classic Infrastructure**.
3. From the devices list, click the server that you want protected.
4. In the **Device Details** page, in the **Configuration** tab, scroll to the end of the page to the **Addons** section and click the **Order Hardware Firewall** link.
5. In the **Order Hardware Firewall** dialog, choose from the options presented (if applicable) and press **Continue** to complete the ordering process. The firewall speed defaults to the speed of the public network interface of your server.
